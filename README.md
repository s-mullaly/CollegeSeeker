# CollegeSeeker

This project was completed as a semester long group project as part of the Georgia Tech MS Analytics program.

The goal of this project was to help high school students understand how college selection may impact future student debt. This project provides a tool for students to discover similar schools and understand student debt differences at these schools.

The code for this project is not available, but the project can be viewed at the following website:
